This 'Music' folder exists to store a secondary version of my website posts.

You may be wondering why on earth I'm simply creating secondary versions of my Website posts (which are mainly just HTML).

It's to give me more practice with GitHub and expand my understand of maintaining a repo.
Simple as that.

Feel free to check out my list (and click on any 'Daily Music' files that you think are interesting).
I'll ensure to link back to my existing website pages so that you can listen to the music as intended.

Thank you for reading.
Have a great day.
